\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Your Wiki contains information about places, people, events, and ideas - all of these are Articles. Articles are the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93whats\u8221\'94 of your world and make up the bulk of the Wiki. Articles are written on vertical 3x5 index cards with the title along the top. Put a quick overview of what the Article is about just below that. A sentence or two is enough to convey the jist of it - any more information can be added as Facts after that.}

\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Facts are little tidbits of information that flesh out the premise of an Article. The Article will have a basic concept but Facts are where you elaborate on it and tie it into the world. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re short, maybe a sentence or two, and are always connected to a Source. Facts are written either on the top half of a sticky note (make sure to leave enough room on the bottom for the next one to stick to) or on the bottom half of a vertical 3x5 index card (make sure to leave space on the top to stack under the Article or Facts above it). In either case, pick a Source that you think could be where that Fact gets established and write its marker in the top left of the Fact. }}

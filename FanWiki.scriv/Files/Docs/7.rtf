\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\cf1\cb1\highlight1 Sources reflect the stories and documents that your Wiki pulls from. A Source might be a movie or a book, or it might even be a particular work within the fiction itself. Whenever you establish a Fact on your Wiki you have to link that Fact to a Source. The easiest way to do this is to put a little symbol on the corner of your Sources and write that symbol on any Fact that is connected to it.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\cf1\cb1\highlight1 The first Source in the game is the Pitch, but after that Sources are created when someone contributes to the Wiki and wants to add a second Fact to their contribution. When you add a Source to the game this way, give it a title and briefly summarize it. If the Source is supposed to be a part of the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93real world\u8221\'94 in your game, like a movie or book, talk about the summary of that story. If it\u8217\'92s instead a part of the \u8220\'93fictional world\u8221\'94 of your game, mention who or what wrote it and what perspective they might have.}

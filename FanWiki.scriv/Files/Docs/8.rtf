\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 FanWiki plays out over a series of turns. During those turns, you and the other players will be contributing articles to the Wiki and cross-referencing sources. The Wiki will be small and without much detail in the beginning, but as the turns go on, the Wiki will grow larger, building out the world.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To start, you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll need to do some setup. You\u8217\'92ll need a Pitch for your story-world to set up the game as well as its first story. After that you will transform that story into the first Article on the Wiki and map out some of the world\u8217\'92s details. Once those first Facts have been established, you then take turns adding to the Wiki by creating Articles, Facts, and Sources. There\u8217\'92s no direct end to the game; just keep playing until you feel like you\u8217\'92ve added enough to flesh out the world for your needs.}

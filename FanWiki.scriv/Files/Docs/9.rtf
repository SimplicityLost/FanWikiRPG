Write its title on an index card and tell everyone broadly what the Article is about. A few short sentences to get everyone on the same page should suffice, but don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t add too many. That\u8217\'92s what Facts are for. After you\u8217\'92ve added the Article you get to add one Fact to that Article. Facts are simple statements written on sticky notes and attached to the Article. Try to limit each Fact to a single idea - Articles can have as many Facts on them as they need so there\u8217\'92s always an opportunity to add more. Each Fact also needs a Source to identify where that information came from. You can either choose an existing Source or add a new one to the pool. If you choose a Source that is already on the table you may add an additional Fact to any other Article on the Wiki, citing the Source that you chose. If you choose to create a new Source for the Wiki you may instead add an additional Fact to the Article that you just contributed, citing that Source.}}
